      <h3>Gap year of 2024</h3>
      <p>My last year of highschool, I decided that I wasn't gonna go straight to
      University, I decided I was gonna take a Gap Year and figure things out. It was the best decision I ever made!
      Through out this gap year, I have done many things. I took a ski instructor course and became a ski instructor in Switzerland,
      I took a social media course in London, I went travelling to Madeira in Portugal, and now Im taking a Web Development course
      at Le wagon in Alvalade, Lisbon.</p>

    <div class="card"><h3>American Life</h3>
      <p>For my last year of highschool I decided that I would complete it in the
      United States more specificaly in California. I had, had a lot of difficult and good times in my life, but nothing compares
      to how last year in America affected me. Leaving my family, my friends, and all I had ever known behind was the biggest challenge I have had to overcome to this day.
      This year was the best and the worst of my life. Being away from my family was painful. It hurt more than I expected and anticipated, but being in America, meeting new people, learning, observing
      the different culture, exploring new topics, and many other things saved me from the pain. All of this to explain, even though I had the most challenging year of my life, all those tears and hard work throughout the year were
      worth it because they brought me where I am today, and made me a better person.</p>
